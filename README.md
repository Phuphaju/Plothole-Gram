# Plothole-Gram

Welcome to Plothole-Gram!
The goal of this project is simple, take a photo of a pothole and when you map the coordinates, it will show a pin of the location on the map.

# Why I built this

I have an absolute passion for urban planning. Walkability, bikeability, and public transit are very important for me. I wanted to try and figure out to create a social media that I could constinously build as I learnt more and more about FullStack Development. 
Currently the map is interactable, I plan to add the pins of posts as I learn more!
