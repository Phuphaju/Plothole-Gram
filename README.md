# Plothole-Gram

Welcome to Plothole-Gram!
The goal of this project is simple, take a photo of a pothole and when you map the coordinates, it will show a pin of the location on the map.

# Why I built this

I have an absolute passion for urban planning. Walkability, bikeability, and public transit are very important for me. This project was a tad ambitious for me as I implemented the map and tried to get the pins to display on the map.
